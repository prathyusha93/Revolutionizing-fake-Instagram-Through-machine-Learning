Fake Instagram Profile Detection using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake Instagram profiles using machine learning techniques. It analyzes user profile attributes, engagement patterns, and metadata to classify accounts as genuine or fake.

âœ… Features
âœ” Preprocessing and cleaning Instagram user data
âœ” Feature extraction (follower ratio, engagement rate, post frequency)
âœ” Implementation of multiple ML models:
   Logistic Regression
   Random Forest
   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
âœ” Data visualization for analysis and performance comparison

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
